# minimum_enclosing_circle-MEC-b-spline
Spline curves are a strip used to create a straight curve in a set of points. The definition of the problem is the Minimum circumferential Circle problem, also known as the      smallest circle problem or the Minimum inclusive circle problem.

-> Given N points in a 2-dimensional plane with integer coordinates by the user requested in the project, you are asked to draw a circle with a minimum surrounding radius containing all points.

-> You are asked to draw the curve passing the nearest given n point.

-> You are asked to calculate the radius and center of the circle you have drawn.
